## View Data
View counts are refreshed for all **non-dormant** songs tracked by this website on a daily basis.

**Vocaloid Rankings** currently counts views for songs from three platforms; [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), [Niconico](https://www.nicovideo.jp/), and [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.tv). All song view counts are acquired by the offical APIs provided by these platforms.

## Dormant Songs
Dormant songs do not have their view counts refreshed daily. 
Instead, their view counts will only be refreshed when their page is visited, a maximum of once per day.

A song will become dormant if it meets **all** of the following criteria:

1. The song receives less than 1,500 views per day.
2. It was published more than one year ago.
3. It was added to the website more than three days ago.

## Song Data
**Vocaloid Rankings** sources all non-view song data from [VocaDB](https://vocadb.net/). 
This includes data such as song names, video links, singers, producers, and more.

As a result, all song IDs on this website are the same as song IDs used at VocaDB.
